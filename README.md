✅ Project Name: Highly Available Multi-Tier Web Architecture on AWS



🔧 Project Description \& Resume Bullet Points:



Designed and deployed a secure and highly available 3-tier architecture on AWS using a custom VPC with 4 subnets (1 public, 3 private) across 2 Availability Zones to ensure fault tolerance and scalability.



Configured networking components such as Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Elastic IP, and custom route tables to enable controlled internet access for public and private resources.



Provisioned EC2 instances for Bastion Host, Web Server, and App Server with Amazon Linux 2 AMIs, along with automated setup via user data scripts for Apache and MariaDB.



Deployed a private RDS instance of MariaDB with a secure subnet group and no public access, connected internally from the app server through SSH bastion tunneling for secure database operations.



💼 Use Cases:



Real-world simulation of secure infrastructure for production web applications with layered access control.



Demonstrates knowledge of networking, security group management, EC2, RDS, and Linux server automation in AWS.



Ideal for hosting web apps with strict security, high availability, and scalability requirements (e.g., e-commerce, internal business apps).
